## Cardioid animation on Unity

A simple animation of an Cardioid on Unity. 

We can build a cardioid simply using points and math. First, we instantiate $n$ points in circle shape. Each point can be numbered from 0 to $n$. The figure we want to form is a cardioid, so each point must connect to the numbering point $2\times n$.

</div></br>

We can form other figures with $3\times n$, $4\times n$, ... $m\times n$.
